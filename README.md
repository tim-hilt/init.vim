# Neovim-Configuration

Install by cloning the repo and opening `nvim`. The package-manager and initial package-installation is set up automatically.

When opening for the first, some plugins may complain about missing binaries (`fzf`, `tree-sitter`). Just install these using your favorite package manager and try to open `nvim` a second time.

## TODO

1. Set up auto-completiong with `coc.nvim`
2. Set up and use snippets using `ultisnips`
